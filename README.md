When describing each wrench or twist system: (a) provide a basis giving the vector components of the basis twist/wrenches in a chosen reference frame; (b) give an adequate geometric description of the system by specifying screws of what pitches underlie the system and what are the locations of their axes (for finite-pitch screws) or their directions (for infinite-pitch screws).

<strong>PM1.</strong> In The 5R Leg 1, joint axes 1 and 2 are parallel, and so are 4, 5, and 6, while 2 and 3 are skew. In the PRRR Leg 2, the axes of joints 2, 3, and 4 are parallel, and the direction of joint 1 (the slider) is <em>not</em> perpendicular to the revolute-joint axes. In the configuration shown: all joint axes in Leg 1 are horizontal, while those in Leg 2 are not.   <strong>PM1.4</strong>. Repeat steps PM1.1-3 for the mechanism obtained by removing the first two joints in leg 1 and the P joint in leg 2. Can these three joints be used to actuate the original mechanism?

<strong>PM2. </strong>In each 5R leg, joints 1, 2, and 3 intersect in a point in the base, common for the four legs. Joint axes 4 and 5 are parallel to each other and to a plane in the platform common for the four legs.

<strong> </strong>PM2.4. Describe and draw a serial chain with the same full-cycle mobility of the end-effector as the PM.

PM2.5. Repeat steps PM2.1-3 for the mechanism obtained from PM2 by removing (blocking) joint 4 in one of the legs. Would the result change if a joint 5 is removed instead? What if all 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> joints are removed?




<strong>PM3.</strong> In each leg: joint axes 1 and 2 are parallel to a common direction fixed in the base. Joint axes 3, 4, 5 intersect in a point in the platform, common for all legs. Assume that the five joint twists in a leg are independent.

<strong>            </strong>PM3.4. Consider one of the legs as a separate serial chain. Can its joint twists become dependent? If yes, describe and illustrate all such leg postures. How would the wrench and twist systems of the PM change if <em>one</em> of its legs is in such a singular posture?

<strong>PM4.</strong> In each 5R leg, joint axes 2, 3, 4, are parallel (but not coplanar) and perpendicular to both joint axes 1 and 5. The three base-joint axes, as well as the three platform-joint axes, are concurrent and coplanar. In this configuration, joints axes 1 and 5 coincide for each leg and all joint 3 axes are horizontal (i.e., all joint axes are horizontal).

PM4.4. Repeat steps PM1.1-3 for the mechanism obtained from PM1 by removing (i.e. blocking) the first joints in all legs.
